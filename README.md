Case Study:- Image Processing 

In this case study, I took threat images (knife) and implimented operations like crop, resize, blur and gray_seg (find the non-zero min-max coords of canny) . This was
followed by super imposition of cropped_images on background_images (bag). We use a nested for loop in order for every threat item to be placed in every bag with correct 
size, angle, attribute(height and width) and offset in order to place the object correctly. 

Commonly implemented in airports where in background x-ray images of baggage that gets generated after passing through a X-ray machine at 
airport. Threat images are the x-ray images of threats that are prohibited at airport while travelling.
